      "## Actionable Improvements for App User Experience:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the negative user reviews, here's a list of actionable improvements focused on solving the pain points:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Improve Account Management & Authentication:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Action:** Implement robust account recovery mechanisms.  Provide clear error messages for invalid credentials and ensure users receive notifications for account-related events (e.g., forced sign-outs).  Investigate and fix the \"invalid credentials\" bug.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Enhance Content Discovery & Personalization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Action:**  Revise the home screen personalization. Offer users clear options to display their subscribed content *without* mandatory recommendations. Provide a setting to toggle recommendations on/off.  Consider reverting to the previous API if feasible, based on user feedback.  Investigate and fix inaccuracies in episode tracking and captions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Fix Messaging & Chat Functionality:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Action:**  Debug the chat system to ensure accurate read receipts. Investigate why messages are marked as unread despite being read by the recipient.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Address Ads & Premium Features:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Action:** Review the ad frequency and length for premium subscribers.  Reduce ad intrusion, especially during live sports and premium content playback. Clearly communicate the benefits of a premium subscription and address the discrepancy between advertised features and user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Improve Booking & Transaction Processes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Action:** Review and optimize the booking process.  Clearly display all fees (including processing fees) upfront. Implement a better refund policy to address booking errors and customer concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Enhance App Stability & Performance:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Action:**  Thoroughly test the app across various devices and operating systems to identify and fix bugs.  Prioritize bug fixes related to content playback (e.g., missing replies, incorrect episode tracking).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**7. Improve Meeting Functionality (if applicable):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Action:** Address the connectivity issues hindering users from joining meetings.  Investigate and fix the problems that led to missed important school tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**8.  Improve Overall UI/UX Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Action:** Conduct a UX audit to improve the overall intuitiveness and ease of use of the app.  Simplify the user interface and make it more purposeful and less annoying.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**General Recommendation:** Prioritize user feedback. Implement a system for collecting and responding to user complaints and suggestions.  Regularly update the app with bug fixes and performance improvements.  Conduct A/B testing to validate changes and ensure they improve the user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "üí° Suggestions for 'cost':\n",
      "\n",
      "Actionable Improvements to Reduce Negative Cost Perceptions:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Address Premium Subscription Value:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Reduce Ad Frequency/Length for Premium Users:**  The most frequent complaint is excessive ads, even with a premium subscription.  Implement a significantly reduced ad load for premium users, ideally to a level that feels genuinely ad-free, aligning with user expectations for a paid service.  Clearly communicate this improved ad-free experience in marketing materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Transparency and Fairness in Pricing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Detailed Breakdown of Fees:** Clearly show all fees (processing, booking, etc.) upfront during the booking process.  Avoid hidden costs that lead to negative surprises.  Compare processing fees to competitors and aim for competitive pricing or justify higher fees with added value (e.g., superior customer service).\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Refund Policy Improvement:** The complaint about non-refundable bookings needs addressing.  Develop a transparent and fair refund policy, clearly communicating the terms and conditions to users *before* booking.  Consider offering refunds for legitimate reasons (e.g., errors on the app's side).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**3.  Improve Functionality and Reduce Frustration:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Bug Fixes and UI/UX Improvements:** Multiple reviews mention bugs and a poor user interface.  Prioritize bug fixes to improve reliability and address functionality issues.  Invest in UX/UI redesign for improved usability and intuitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Improve Search Functionality (JioTV):**  Specifically for JioTV, create a dedicated, easy-to-use search function for individual channels, improving discoverability and navigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Enhance Customer Service:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Improved Customer Support:** Users report poor customer service. Invest in improving response times and providing helpful solutions to user issues.  The response of \"technical troubleshooting steps\" to a complaint about excessive ads is inadequate.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5.  Re-evaluate the Business Model (Ads):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Balance Ads and Premium Features:**  Consider revising the ad strategy for both free and premium users. The current ad experience is perceived as excessively intrusive and detracts significantly from user experience, even for paying customers.  Explore alternative monetization strategies to reduce reliance on disruptive ads.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing these points, the app can significantly improve user satisfaction and address the negative sentiment related to cost, both in terms of monetary expenditure and the perceived value received.\n",
      "\n",
      "üí° Suggestions for 'performance':\n",
      "\n",
      "## Actionable Improvements for App Performance:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Account & Authentication:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Robust Sign-in/Sign-out:** Implement more reliable authentication methods. Investigate why users are unexpectedly signed out and fix the \"invalid credentials\" error when signing in with Google. Include proper notifications for sign-out events.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Content Playback & Ads:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Reliable Playback:** Fix issues causing videos to pause unexpectedly after ads, particularly impacting specific content like \"Naagin.\"  Thoroughly test playback across different devices and network conditions.\n",
      "* **Targeted Ads:**  Reduce the frequency and intrusiveness of ads, especially during live sports. Explore more relevant ad placement strategies to improve user experience.  Clearly communicate ad policies to avoid user frustration.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Bug Fixes & UI/UX:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Error Handling:**  Address the many reported bugs, including the inability to detect last watched episode, incorrect captions,  and broken infinite scroll. Provide clear error messages to users rather than generic error screens.\n",
      "* **UI/UX Improvements:** Redesign the UI to improve intuitiveness and purpose.  Prioritize ease of navigation and accessibility.\n",
      "* **Connectivity Issues:** Investigate and resolve connectivity problems preventing users from joining meetings (e.g., Google Meet integration) and showing \"internet not connected\" errors even with a connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Data Accuracy & Features:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Data Synchronization:** Improve the accuracy of data synchronization across devices.  Ensure the app correctly tracks the user‚Äôs progress (e.g., last viewed episode).\n",
      "* **Notification Control:** Implement granular control over notifications, allowing users to disable specific types (e.g., upvotes).\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Customer Support & Refund Policy:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Improved Support:** Improve the speed and quality of customer support, especially regarding booking errors and refunds.  Make the refund process clearer and more transparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Stability & Updates:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Regression Testing:** Implement thorough regression testing before releasing updates to prevent new bugs from being introduced.\n",
      "* **Update Communication:** Clearly communicate the fixes and improvements included in each update to build user trust.\n",
